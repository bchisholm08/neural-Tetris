"Z:\13-humanTetris\data\ggPilot_02\eyeData\ggPilot_02_gameReplay006_gaze.mat"

"Z:\13-humanTetris\data\ggPilot_02\eyeData\ggPilot_02_game006_gaze.mat"

where file tag is "subjID_game000_gaze.mat" for PLAYING tetris 
and "subjID_gameReplay000_gaze.mat" for when participants watch a replay. 

Each file 
```{r}
# library(R.matlab)
# library(BiocManager)
library(hdf5r)
# library(rhdf5)
myFilePath = "Z:/13-humanTetris/data/ggPilot_02/eyeData/ggPilot_02_game004_gaze.mat"
hdf5r::new(filename = myFilePath)
```
