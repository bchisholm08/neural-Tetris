This repo is a collection of code for the Jean-Paul Noel Lab at the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities.

The purpose of this experiment is to create a paradigm that utilizes the game of Tetris to investigate whether a Tetris piece and the visualization of the piece differs when:

	The piece is alone with no context.
	The piece has an action implied that could be made.
	The piece has an action implied that results in a reward.
